# Mythical Metallurgy
Minecraft Data pack that adds custom materials to the game to add an ore/tool progression past diamond and netherite.

Material progression will start around the diamond/netherite level in which the player will be able to craft a pickaxe that can extract rare and magical materials from
stone. Previously unseen by the player, this pickaxe extracts the trace amounts of these materials in stone, amplifying the amount found through magic.

Plans are to add various materials commonly found in fantasy with custom in-world and in-table crafting.
